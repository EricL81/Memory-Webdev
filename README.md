# About this Project:

 This is a project I did following a Javascript Course on Domestika. It's a single-page application. All screen changes are made in Javascript. After the Bootcamp I attended, I came back to this game to adapt it to my new career and made some changes to convert it to a Memory Game with theme "Web Development" :)

   - 2 Play Modus: Normal / Relax
   - Normal mode: Time and Moves are limited 
   - Relax mode: Level selection in Relax Mode
   - Random card distribution each time
